#### Description:

The Mental Health Chatbot is a Python-based interactive chatbot designed to provide mental health support. This chatbot is not a replacement for professional help, but it can provide immediate resources, positive affirmations, calming activities, and mood tracking.

The chatbot is comprised of several key features:

1. **Positive Affirmations:** The chatbot can provide positive affirmations to uplift the user's mood.
2. **Calming Activities:** The chatbot can suggest calming activities that can help reduce stress and anxiety.
3. **Mental Health Resources:** The chatbot provides a list of Canadian mental health resources, including hotlines and websites for immediate professional help.
4. **Mood Tracking:** The chatbot allows users to input their mood and keeps track of the user's mood history.
5. **Mood History:** The chatbot enables users to view their mood history to understand their emotional patterns better.

The project includes two Python files: `project.py` and `test_project.py`.

`project.py` is the main script that runs the chatbot. It contains several functions:

- `main()`: This is the main function of the script that provides an interactive interface to the user.
- `get_positive_affirmation()`: This function returns a random positive affirmation.
- `get_calming_activity()`: This function returns a random calming activity.
- `get_mental_health_resources()`: This function provides a list of Canadian mental health resources.
- `track_mood(mood)`: This function tracks the user's mood and stores it in a list.
- `print_mood_history()`: This function prints the user's mood history.

`test_project.py` contains tests for the functions in `project.py`. The tests are designed to check the functionality of the core components of the chatbot.

In designing the chatbot, the primary focus was user interaction and ease of use. The chatbot uses a simple text interface, and the responses are designed to be positive and encouraging. The goal was to create a tool that could provide immediate comfort and help for anyone experiencing stress, anxiety, or just needing a bit of positivity in their day.

Please note that this chatbot is not a replacement for professional help.
